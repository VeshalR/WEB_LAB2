                <h3>Official Picture Session</h3>
                <p>It was a wonderful and interesting experience to serve as a facilitator for new students for the October intake during
                   Minggu Haluan Siswa (MHS) week as a member of the Security and Welfare executive committee. During their first few 
                   days on campus, I assisted freshmen in adjusting to university life by making them feel safe and supported. In 
                   addition to making sure that students were safe, my duties as a Security and Welfare exco member included creating a 
                   friendly and inclusive atmosphere. This involved setting up safety instructions, managing housing, that let students 
                   interact and form friendships.</p>

                <h3>Closing Caremony</h3>
                <p>Establishing safety procedures for students was a big part of my duties. I made sure they had a safe way to get from 
                   the hostel and to the Dewan Sultan Ibrahim (DSI) every morning and back to the hostel every night, and I helped them 
                   on their way to the mosque for lunch and dinner. Even though the work was frequently exhausting, the experience was 
                   priceless. I learned the value of flexibility, leadership, and communication, especially when responding to their 
                   issues and helping them overcome obstacles. Throughout the MHS, it was satisfying to watch new students gain comfort 
                   and confidence. All things considered, becoming a facilitator gave me the opportunity to positively impact the 
                   university community while developing important teamwork, compassion, and problem management skills that I think will
                   help me in the future.</p>
